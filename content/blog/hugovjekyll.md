Static site generators are quickly becoming a staple of the professional web developer's toolbox and as such I was keen to implement it when refreshing my personal site.

From the moment I started creating the site I knew I wanted to do so using some sort of CMS/site generator, essentially anything to abstract away from editing raw html files (soo oldschool) to make editing and uploading new content as simple as possible. A full blown CMS seemed a bit absurd for the requirements of this small site and came with far too much overheard &amp; setup for my liking. Luckily, static site generators fit the bill perfectly, allowing developers to create simple markdown files which are then compiled down into raw html/css/etc. to form the site.

After some research, I found that at the moment there is the big boy of SSGs (static site generators) in Jekyll and there's it's up-and-coming rival, Hugo. In this post, i'll explain the fruits of my research and detail what I found to be the most important pros and cons of each static site generator.

# Jekyll

Jekyll is the current leader of the pack, being the go-to choice for many developers. It describes itself as *"a simple, blog-aware, static site generator"*

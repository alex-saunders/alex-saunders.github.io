Welcome to my site, here you can find blog posts where I talk about what i'm working on, what technologies i'm currently playing with or anything else that comes to mind.
You can also see what work i've been up to in the 'projects' section.

I am a student at the University of Liverpool studying towards a BSc in Computer Science. Currently, I am undertaking an internship at Shop Direct between my second and third year of study.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/alex-saunders), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjrsaunders) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexJRsaunders).

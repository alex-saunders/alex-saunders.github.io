&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are quickly becoming a staple of the professional web developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox and as such I was keen to implement it when refreshing my personal site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the moment I started creating the site I knew I wanted to do so using some sort of CMS/site generator, essentially anything to abstract away from editing raw html files (soo oldschool) to make editing and uploading new content as simple as possible. A full blown CMS seemed a bit absurd for the requirements of this small site and came with far too much overheard &amp;amp; setup for my liking. Luckily, static site generators fit the bill perfectly, allowing developers to create simple markdown files which are then compiled down into raw html/css/etc. to form the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some research, I found that at the moment there is the big boy of SSGs (static site generators) in Jekyll and there&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s up-and-coming rival, Hugo. In this post, i&amp;rsquo;ll explain the fruits of my research and detail what I found to be the most important pros and cons of each static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is the current leader of the pack, being the go-to choice for many developers. It describes itself as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;a simple, blog-aware, static site generator&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&lt;/p&gt;
